    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
	<li><a> Rice (as much as you fancy really!)</a></li>
	<li><a> Half an onion (Or more, again if you fancy it)</a></li>
	<li><a> A tin of sweetcorn</a></li>
	<li><a> A few mushrooms</a></li>
	<li><a> 1-2 eggs (optional)</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <ul>
	<h><a> 1) Start cooking the rice however you do, and put some oil in a frying pan.</a></h>
	<h1> </h1>
	<h><a> 2) Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesn't matter particularly and throw into the frying pan.</a></h>
	<h1> </h1>
	<h><a> 3) Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions.</a></li>
	<h1> </h1>
	<h><a> 4) Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add it into the frying pan.</a></h>
	<h1> </h1>
	<h><a> 5) Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up.</a></h>
	<h1> </h1>
	<h><a> 6) Break the eggs into the pan (OR beat them together in another bowl and tip into the frying pan) and stir the mixture up.</a></h>
        <h1> </h1>
	<h><a> 7) At this point, you need to keep stirring the mixture, keeping the eggs moving. Keep going until the eggs have cooked, should take about 5-8 minutes maybe?</a></h>
